The problem :

A component of a system is subject to stochastic failures. If the 
component fails an identical component is switched on and the broken
component is replaced. The system as a whole goes down when the
standby fails before the broken one is replaced. We are interested
in the life time of the system and the chances that this life time is
greater then 5,10,15... We know that the life time of one component
follows a weibull distribution with parameters 0.9080 and 1.4355 and
that the replacement time is equal to one time unit.

The program :

The program consists of a failure event, that quits the simulation
if both parts are down or waits if the component is replaced in time.
Notice that there is always one part down when the failure event is
activated. The exponential distribution is fitted on the resulting
probability histogram. The resulting chi square statistic suggests a
reasonable fit. More tests should be performed before one can say
that the probability histogram follows the exponential distribution.
