This directory contains a variety of example programs. Some are 
event-based as well as process- oriented and some have have a 
grafical interface. 
All programs can be linked to both the ASCII and the HUSH version of
the library. The ASCII library is faster as the HUSH library,
but has no grafical features.
If you want to link a program to the ASCII library include the 
ascii.mk file in your makefile, if you want to link it to the HUSH
version include the resource.mk file.
