The problem :

With the alternating bit protocol when a frame is transmitted a time
out is set, that expires if no acknowledgement for the transmitted
frame has been received in the permitted time. We transmit 
packets from 1024 bytes with a line speed of 4096 bytes a second.
So a transmission of a packet should last 0.25 seconds and the
time out expires in 0.52 seconds. We are interested in the 
amount of data that is successfully transmitted, given the bit
error rate.

The program :
The events in this problem are the transmit, the receive, the 
acknowledge and the time out event. We can combine the first three
events in a process frame. The transmit event schedules a receive
event with a probability p and a time out event. The receive event 
schedules an acknowledgement if the sequence numbers of the packets
do agree (and no frame has been lost). The acknowledge event
passivates the time out and schedules a new transmission. The
probability p is calculated as the inverse of the bit error rate times 
the size of the frame (i.e. 1024 bytes). So if we have a bit error
rate of 1/10000, the probability of a successful transmission is equal
to 0.89.
