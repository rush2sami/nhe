The problem :

Customers arrive at a service point with an initial amount of 1, where 
the interarrival of customers and the service are exponentially
distributed with respectively 1/5 minute and 1/6 minute as mean.
We are interested in the size of the queue and the waiting times of
customers over the entire day and over the period when the behavior
is steady. 

The program :

The program consists of the events arrival, departure and service. The
implementation of these events as well as the implementation as an 
entity is straightforward. In the main function we run the simulation
for a day with both the histogram of the waiting times and the histogram
of the queue size analyzed on steady state behavior. From inspecting 
these histograms we obtained an initial transient period of 50 minutes.
We first reset the simulation and it's belongings and run the simulation
for 50 minutes and then for the remaining day. During the second run
the samples are taken after the initial transient period.
