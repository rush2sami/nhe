The problem :

Cars arriving at the tankstation can choose between lpg and gasoline.
The station has three pomps for gasoline and one for lpg. Two
servants connect, fill and disconnect the car, when it is served.
If the car is filled with lpg or gasoline the servant is free to
serve other cars. It is known that 70% from the cars wants gasoline.
Furthermore the connecting, the filling, the disconnecting and the
inter-arrival time of a car are uniformly distributed with parameters
respectively 2 and 4, 5 and 9, 3 and 5 and 2 and 8 minutes.

We are interested in the occupation of the pomps and of the 
servants, in sizes of the queues for the pomps and for the servants
and in the covariance and correlation of these sizes.
The results should be given for the first 10000 cars, that
arrive at the station.

The program :

The program consists of three resources for the pomps and servants.
They all have a queue in front of them and receive a report on the
occupation and the size of the queue. The processes are modeled by
the entities car, servant and station. If a car arrives it is
appended to the lpg or gasoline queue and when removed it is again
appended to the service queue. After being removed from this queue
the car is filled and once again appended to the service queue for
the disconnecting of the car. If disconnected the car can depart from
the station. Notice that the phase of the car chances during this 
process from ARRIVAL to CONNECT to FILL to DISCONNECT to DEPARTURE.
The run method receives the integer 10000 as parameter and the cars
receive a kill flag when created, so if 10000 cars have been
terminated, the simulation stops. After the running of the simulation
the covariance and correlationcoefficient of the size of the service
queue and the sizes of the lpq and gasoline queue are determined.
They appear to be uncorrelated.
