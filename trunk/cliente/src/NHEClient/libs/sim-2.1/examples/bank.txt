The problem :

In a bank customers arrive and are served according to the exponential 
distribution. A customer that arrives takes the first service point with the
queue of minimal size in front of it. We are interested in the
queue sizes and occupation of each service point. Furthermore we
are interested in the actual time that the customer is in the
post office. The parameters of the model are : the number of service point,
the means of the inter-arrival time and service time and the day
length in hours.

The program :

The implementation is straightforward. The program consists of
an arrival, departure and service event.  The statistics are gathered 
with the report members.
