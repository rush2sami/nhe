The problem :

Airplanes land and depart from an airport with three landing zones, 
where they are served. Landing airplanes have a higher priority when 
acquiring the landing zone. Furthermore the airplanes can be of type 1 
and of type 2. Airplanes of type 1 have a higher priority then airplanes
of type 2. The inter-arrival time, landing time, departing time and
working time are given in the next table :

         arrival(day)    arrival(night)  landing   working  departing 
       --------------------------------------------------------------
type 1 | gamma(0.05,0.5) gamma(0.1,0.5)  exp(2.4)  exp(15)  exp(2.4)
type 2 | gamma(0.04,2.0) gamma(0.1,2.0)  exp(2)    exp(10)  exp(2)

where the inter-arrival and working times are given in hours and
the landing and departing times in minutes.
We are interested in the waiting times for landing and departing 
airplanes taking the type in account. Furthermore we'd like the report
printed each day the simulation runs.

The program :
The events in this problem are the land, work, finish work and depart
event for an airplane and the serve landing and serve departing events
for the server. The implementation of these events is straightforward.
The events or processes receive a queuing priority when created
so they will be appended to the queue in priority order. The queue
receives a report for each priority. These reports are printed to
standard output each day the simulation runs.
