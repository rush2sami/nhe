The problem :

Ships arrive at a harbour following an exponential
distribution with 4/3 (days) as mean. The harbour can
handle two ships. The processing time is uniformly
distributed between 0.25 and 0.75, if the ship is the
only ship in the harbour. Otherwise the processing time is 
uniformly distributed between 0.5 and 1.5.
We are interested in statistics of the waiting times and number of
waiting ships.

The program :
The program consists of the events arrival, departure and service, 
that can be combined in the processes ship and server, a resource 
harbour with an initial amount 2 and the queue, that gets reports on 
the size and waiting times. The program makes a long run and splits
this run in several subruns, thus decreasing the variance of the 
results, (method of batch means).
