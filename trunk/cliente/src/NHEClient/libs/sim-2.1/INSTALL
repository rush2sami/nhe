The most convenient way is to obtain hush
and install sim as a package under hush.
If you don't have hush, then

1. Modify local.mk to indicate the install directory.
   This is the HUSH variable.

2. Replace the include in Makefile by 

   include local.mk

3. And similarly for resource.mk. Note that
   resource.mk is include one directory below,
   that is src (and possibly ascii).

4. Change in src/Makefile the CFLAGS as indicated
   to CFLAGS += -DASCII

5. Then type make install, or make build
   to test.

Warning:
	This procedure of installation has not been tested
	extensively.
